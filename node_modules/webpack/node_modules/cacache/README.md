[`cacache`](https://github.com/npm/cacache) is a Node.js library for managing
local key and content address caches. It's really fast, really good at
concurrency, and it will never give you corrupted data, even if cache files
get corrupted or manipulated.

On systems that support user and group settings on files, cacache will
match the `uid` and `gid` values to the folder where the cache lives, even
when running as `root`.

It was written to be used as [npm](https://npm.im)'s local cache, but can
just as easily be used on its own.

### Example

```javascript
const cacache = require('cacache/en')
const fs = require('fs')

const tarball = '/path/to/mytar.tgz'
const cachePath = '/tmp/my-toy-cache'
const key = 'my-unique-key-1234'

// Cache it! Use `cachePath` as the root of the content cache
cacache.put(cachePath, key, '10293801983029384').then(integrity => {
  console.log(`Saved content to ${cachePath}.`)
})

const destination = '/tmp/mytar.tgz'

// Copy the contents out of the cache and into their destination!
// But this time, use stream instead!
cacache.get.stream(
  cachePath, key
).pipe(
  fs.createWriteStream(destination)
).on('finish', () => {
  console.log('done extracting!')
})

// The same thing, but skip the key index.
cacache.get.byDigest(cachePath, integrityHash).then(data => {
  fs.writeFile(destination, data, err => {
    console.log('tarball data fetched based on its sha512sum and written out!')
  })
})
```

### Features

* Extraction by key or by content address (shasum, etc)
* [Subresource Integrity](#integrity) web standard support
* Multi-hash support - safely host sha1, sha512, etc, in a single cache
* Automatic content deduplication
* Fault tolerance (immune to corruption, partial writes, process races, etc)
* Consistency guarantees on read and write (full data verification)
* Lockless, high-concurrency cache access
* Streaming support
* Promise support
* Pretty darn fast -- sub-millisecond reads and writes including verification
* Arbitrary metadata storage
* Garbage collection and additional offline verification
* Thorough test coverage
* There's probably a bloom filter in there somewhere. Those are cool, right? ü§î

### API

#### <a name="localized-api"></a> Using localized APIs

cacache includes a complete API in English, with the same features as other
translations. To use the English API as documented in this README, use
`require('cacache/en')`. This is also currently the default if you do
`require('cacache')`, but may change in the future.

cacache also supports other languages! You can find the list of currently
supported ones by looking in `./locales` in the source directory. You can use
the API in that language with `require('cacache/<lang>')`.

Want to add support for a new language? Please go ahead! You should be able to
copy `./locales/en.js` and `./locales/en.json` and fill them in. Translating the
`README.md` is a bit more work, but also appreciated if you get around to it. üëçüèº

#### <a name="ls"></a> `> cacache.ls(cache) -> Promise<Object>`

Lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object. Each
entry in the object will be keyed by the unique index key, with corresponding
[`get.info`](#get-info) objects as the values.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.ls(cachePath).then(console.log)
// Output
{
  'my-thing': {
    key: 'my-thing',
    integrity: 'sha512-BaSe64/EnCoDED+HAsh=='
    path: '.testcache/content/deadbeef', // joined with `cachePath`
    time: 12345698490,
    size: 4023948,
    metadata: {
      name: 'blah',
      version: '1.2.3',
      description: 'this was once a package but now it is my-thing'
    }
  },
  'other-thing': {
    key: 'other-thing',
    integrity: 'sha1-ANothER+hasH=',
    path: '.testcache/content/bada55',
    time: 11992309289,
    size: 111112
  }
}
```

#### <a name="ls-stream"></a> `> cacache.ls.stream(cache) -> Readable`

Lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object.

This works just like [`ls`](#ls), except [`get.info`](#get-info) entries are
returned as `'data'` events on the returned stream.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.ls.stream(cachePath).on('data', console.log)
// Output
{
  key: 'my-thing',
  integrity: 'sha512-BaSe64HaSh',
  path: '.testcache/content/deadbeef', // joined with `cachePath`
  time: 12345698490,
  size: 13423,
  metadata: {
    name: 'blah',
    version: '1.2.3',
    description: 'this was once a package but now it is my-thing'
  }
}

{
  key: 'other-thing',
  integrity: 'whirlpool-WoWSoMuchSupport',
  path: '.testcache/content/bada55',
  time: 11992309289,
  size: 498023984029
}

{
  ...
}
```

#### <a name="get-data"></a> `> cacache.get(cache, key, [opts]) -> Promise({data, metadata, integrity})`

Returns an object with the cached data, digest, and metadata identified by
`key`. The `data` property of this object will be a `Buffer` instance that
presumably holds some data that means something to you. I'm sure you know what
to do with it! cacache just won't care.

`integrity` is a [Subresource
Integrity](#integrity)
string. That is, a string that can be used to verify `data`, which looks like
`<hash-algorithm>-<base64-integrity-hash>`.

If there is no content identified by `key`, or if the locally-stored data does
not pass the validity checksum, the promise will be rejected.

A sub-function, `get.byDigest` may be used for identical behavior, except lookup
will happen by integrity hash, bypassing the index entirely. This version of the
function *only* returns `data` itself, without any wrapper.

##### Note

This function loads the entire cache entry into memory before returning it. If
you're dealing with Very Large data, consider using [`get.stream`](#get-stream)
instead.

##### Example

```javascript
// Look up by key
cache.get(cachePath, 'my-thing').then(console.log)
// Output:
{
  metadata: {
    thingName: 'my'
  },
  integrity: 'sha512-BaSe64HaSh',
  data: Buffer#<deadbeef>,
  size: 9320
}

// Look up by digest
cache.get.byDigest(cachePath, 'sha512-BaSe64HaSh').then(console.log)
// Output:
Buffer#<deadbeef>
```

#### <a name="get-stream"></a> `> cacache.get.stream(cache, key, [opts]) -> Readable`

Returns a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) of the cached data identified by `key`.

If there is no content identified by `key`, or if the locally-stored data does
not pass the validity checksum, an error will be emitted.

`metadata` and `integrity` events will be emitted before the stream closes, if
you need to collect that extra data about the cached entry.

A sub-function, `get.stream.byDigest` may be used for identical behavior,
except lookup will happen by integrity hash, bypassing the index entirely. This
version does not emit the `metadata` and `integrity` events at all.

##### Example

```javascript
// Look up by key
cache.get.stream(
  cachePath, 'my-thing'
).on('metadata', metadata => {
  console.log('metadata:', metadata)
}).on('integrity', integrity => {
  console.log('integrity:', integrity)
}).pipe(
  fs.createWriteStream('./x.tgz')
)
// Outputs:
metadata: { ... }
integrity: 'sha512-SoMeDIGest+64=='

// Look up by digest
cache.get.stream.byDigest(
  cachePath, 'sha512-SoMeDIGest+64=='
).pipe(
  fs.createWriteStream('./x.tgz')
)
```

#### <a name="get-info"></a> `> cacache.get.info(cache, key) -> Promise`

Looks up `key` in the cache index, returning information about the entry if
one exists.

##### Fields

* `key` - Key the entry was looked up under. Matches the `key` argument.
* `integrity` - [Subresource Integrity hash](#integrity) for the content this entry refers to.
* `path` - Filesystem path where content is stored, joined with `cache` argument.
* `time` - Timestamp the entry was first added on.
* `metadata` - User-assigned metadata associated with the entry/content.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.get.info(cachePath, 'my-thing').then(console.log)

// Output
{
  key: 'my-thing',
  integrity: 'sha256-MUSTVERIFY+ALL/THINGS=='
  path: '.testcache/content/deadbeef',
  time: 12345698490,
  size: 849234,
  metadata: {
    name: 'blah',
    version: '1.2.3',
    description: 'this was once a package but now it is my-thing'
  }
}
```

#### <a name="get-hasContent"></a> `> cacache.get.hasContent(cache, integrity) -> Promise`

Looks up a [Subresource Integrity hash](#integrity) in the cache. If content
exists for this `integrity`, it will return an object, with the specific single integrity hash
that was found in `sri` key, and the size of the found content as `size`. If no content exists for this integrity, it will return `false`.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.get.hasContent(cachePath, 'sha256-MUSTVERIFY+ALL/THINGS==').then(console.log)

// Output
{
  sri: {
    source: 'sha256-MUSTVERIFY+ALL/THINGS==',
    algorithm: 'sha256',
    digest: 'MUSTVERIFY+ALL/THINGS==',
    options: []
  },
  size: 9001
}

cacache.get.hasContent(cachePath, 'sha521-NOT+IN/CACHE==').then(console.log)

// Output
false
```

#### <a name="put-data"></a> `> cacache.put(cache, key, data, [opts]) -> Promise`

Inserts data passed to it into the cache. The returned Promise resolves with a
digest (generated according to [`opts.algorithms`](#optsalgorithms)) after the
cache entry has been successfully written.

##### Example

```javascript
fetch(
  'https://registry.npmjs.org/cacache/-/cacache-1.0.0.tgz'
).then(data => {
  return cacache.put(cachePath, 'registry.npmjs.org|cacache@1.0.0', data)
}).then(integrity => {
  console.log('integrity hash is', integrity)
})
```

#### <a name="put-stream"></a> `> cacache.put.stream(cache, key, [opts]) -> Writable`

Returns a [Writable
Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_writable_streams) that inserts
data written to it into the cache. Emits an `integrity` event with the digest of
written contents when it succeeds.

##### Example

```javascript
request.get(
  'https://registry.npmjs.org/cacache/-/cacache-1.0.0.tgz'
).pipe(
  cacache.put.stream(
    cachePath, 'registry.npmjs.org|cacache@1.0.0'
  ).on('integrity', d => console.log(`integrity digest is ${d}`))
)
```

#### <a name="put-options"></a> `> cacache.put options`

`cacache.put` functions have a number of options in common.

##### `opts.metadata`

Arbitrary metadata to be attached to the inserted key.

##### `opts.size`

If provided, the data stream will be verified to check that enough data was
passed through. If there's more or less data than expected, insertion will fail
with an `EBADSIZE` error.

##### `opts.integrity`

If present, the pre-calculated digest for the inserted content. If this option
if provided and does not match the post-insertion digest, insertion will fail
with an `EINTEGRITY` error.

`algorithms` has no effect if this option is present.

##### `opts.algorithms`

Default: ['sha512']

Hashing algorithms to use when calculating the [subresource integrity
digest](#integrity)
for inserted data. Can use any algorithm listed in `crypto.getHashes()` or
`'omakase'`/`'„Åä‰ªª„Åõ„Åó„Åæ„Åô'` to pick a random hash algorithm on each insertion. You
may also use any anagram of `'modnar'` to use this feature.

Currently only supports one algorithm at a time (i.e., an array length of
exactly `1`). Has no effect if `opts.integrity` is present.

##### `opts.memoize`

Default: null

If provided, cacache will memoize the given cache insertion in memory, bypassing
any filesystem checks for that key or digest in future cache fetches. Nothing
will be written to the in-memory cache unless this option is explicitly truthy.

If `opts.memoize` is an object or a `Map`-like (that is, an object with `get`
and `set` methods), it will be written to instead of the global memoizatio
